This project is part of the [Rothamsted Data Hackathon](https://github.com/Rothamsted-Ecoinformatics/RothDataHackathon2025). We used data from the [Electronic Rothamsted Archive (e-RA)](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/) on long-term winter wheat experiments (Broadbalk) covering the periods 1990–2000 and 2010–2020. We used [Dataset: Broadbalk Wheat annual grain and straw yields 1968-2022](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/dataset/rbk1/01-YLD6822) 🌱

Across these two time spans, we explore correlations between grain and straw yield, fertiliser use (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), estimated CO₂ emissions (based on nitrogen application), meteorological data (rainfall and temperature), and insect prevalence data from the [Rothamsted Insect Survey](https://insectsurvey.com/). 🪰

We have developed basic, **interactive** data visualisations that users can easily use to understand the raw data held within these complex datasets.

You can view the web resource developed in this project here: [Webpage Link](#)  

We further developed a prediction model of insect total prevalance per month based on previous prevalance data. This is a demonstration of how predictive tools could be integrated into the web resource to be used by farmers.

This platform has been developed with the aim of being **accessible to those who would most benefit from the data**. Plots are designed to be modular and interactive.
