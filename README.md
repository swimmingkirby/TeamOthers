# TeamOthers

This project is part of the [Rothamsted Data Hackathon](https://github.com/Rothamsted-Ecoinformatics/RothDataHackathon2025). We used data from the [Electronic Rothamsted Archive (e-RA)](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/) on long-term winter wheat experiments (Broadbalk) covering the periods 1990â€“2000 and 2010â€“2020. We used [Dataset: Broadbalk Wheat annual grain and straw yields 1968-2022](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/dataset/rbk1/01-YLD6822) ðŸŒ±

Across these two time spans, we explore correlations between grain and straw yield, fertiliser use (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), estimated COâ‚‚ emissions (based on nitrogen application), meteorological data (rainfall and temperature), and insect prevalence data from the [Rothamsted Insect Survey](https://insectsurvey.com/). ðŸª°

We have developed basic, **interactive** data visualisations that users can easily use to understand the raw data held within these complex datasets.

You can view the web resource developed in this project here: [Webpage Link](https://team-others.vercel.app/#future)  

We further developed an example **prediction model** of insect total prevalance per month based on previous prevalance data. This is a demonstration of how predictive tools could be integrated into the web resource to be used by farmers.

This platform has been developed with the aim of being **accessible to those who would most benefit from the data**. Plots are designed to be modular and interactive.
